    <h1>Economics of Social Media EC'25 Tutorial</h1>
    <p>This tutorial is structured into two parts: the first reviews the economics of social media literature, and the second focuses on the practical conduct of experiments on social media to study these questions.</p>

        <h2>1. The Economics of Social Media</h2>
        <p><strong>Article:</strong> <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20241743" target="_blank">The Economics of Social Media</a></p>

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We provide a guide to the burgeoning literature on the economics of social media. We first define social media platforms and highlight their unique features. We then synthesize the main lessons from the empirical economics literature and organize them around the three stages of the life cycle of content: (i) production, (ii) distribution, and (iii) consumption. Under production, we discuss how incentives affect content produced on and off social media and how harmful content is moderated. Under distribution, we discuss the social network structure, algorithms, and targeted advertisements. Under consumption, we discuss how social media affects individuals who consume its content and society at large, and explore consumer substitution patterns across platforms. Throughout the guide, we examine case studies on the deterrence of misinformation, segregation, political advertisements, and the effects of social media on political outcomes. We conclude with a brief discussion of the future of social media.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We provide a practical guide to designing, conducting, and analyzing experiments using social media platforms. First, we discuss the benefits and challenges of using the targeting capabilities of advertisements on social media to recruit participants for a large class of experiments. Next, we outline the different types of interventions and their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we summarize available compliance and outcome data, as well as the main limitations and challenges involved in the design and analysis of social media experiments. Throughout, we provide technical details that are helpful when implementing these experiments. Overall, we argue that experiments on social media are powerful not only for studying economic issues around social media and online platforms but also for experiments studying economic behavior more broadly.</p>

            <h3>Biographical Sketches</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.guyaridor.net"><strong>Guy Aridor</strong></a> is an Assistant Professor of Marketing at Northwestern Kellogg School of Management. Most of his research focuses on policy issues in the digital economy, with a particular focus on consumer privacy, social media, and recommendation systems. His research uses tools from empirical industrial organization, experimental methodologies, and applied microeconomic theory in order to shed light on these questions. His work has appeared or is forthcoming at top journals in economics, marketing, and computer science such as the <i>RAND Journal of Economics</i>, <i>Management Science</i>, and the <i>ACM Transactions on Economics and Computation</i>. His work has been recognized with the best short paper award at the <i>ACM Conference on Recommender Systems</i>.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.songlena.com"><strong>Lena Song</strong></a> is an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Her research draws on tools from applied microeconomics, behavioral economics, and experimental economics to examine the societal impacts of media and digital technologies. Her work has been published in the American Economic Review, American Economic Review: Insights, and ACM Computer Science and Law. Her ongoing projects explore social media use among youth and young adults, and how digital platforms and generative AI influence discourse and public opinion.
